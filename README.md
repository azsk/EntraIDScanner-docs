# EntraIDScanner-docs

### Welcome to the documentation of Entra ID Scanner!

AzSK.AAD  was made available, five years back as part of DevOpsKit, in preview to facilitate checking security configuration and best practices for Azure Active Directory (AAD), now known as Entra ID. 

The team has started the development again with fresh set of controls. AzSK is not an official Microsoft product â€“ rather an attempt to share Microsoft best practices with the community.  The scanner currently supports the ability to scan objects of type app registrations and enterprise applications owned by a specific user (a feature that an individual user in the tenant can use) or in the entire tenant.

In the coming iterations more controls would be added to cover other areas of Entra ID too. To ease out the transition for legacy users, we are launching the module with the same name AzSK.AAD. This would also be changed to AzSK.EntraID in coming sprints.
